\section{Introduction}

\section{Tools Used}

First and foremost we want to mention that often use Jetbrains IntelliJ and Codescene as a starting point as they both provide functionality for multiple of the below mentioned subsections.

\subsection{Duplicate Code}
\subsection{Metrics and Visualisation}

For metrics and visualisation (as well as other things) we will mostly be using Codescene.

\subsection{Mining Repositories}
\subsection{Refactoring Assistants}
\subsection{Test Coverage and Dynamic Analysis}

For test coverage, we plan on using LittleDarwin to perform mutation testing on the project. However, during our assignments for the Software Testing course, we already used LittleDarwin for that project, and even on such a small project it took a fairly long while to run LittleDarwin. Because of this, and because of the other tasks, assignments... we have, we have not yet used LittleDarwin.

\subsection{Feature Location and Traceability}
